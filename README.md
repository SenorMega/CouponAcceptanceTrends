# **Independent Investigation**

Using the bar coupon example as motivation, you are to explore one of the other coupon groups and try to determine the characteristics of passengers who accept the coupons. 

I will investigate the group that received Coffee House coupons. Based on my experience in the previous section, I am going to break out this data in three main category types:

1. Demographic. This includes information about the person who received the coupon offer. The categories are: age, gender, education, occupation, marital status and whether or not they have children
2. Situational. What was going on when the coupon was offered? The categories are: time of day, temperature, destination of driver, and whether or not they had a passenger with them
3. Historical. How frequently do they visit the various types of establishments for which coupons are being offered? The categories are: Coffee House, Bar, Carry out & Take away, Low- and Mid-Priced restaurants
 

## Demographic Data Breakdown

For the coffee coupons, there was very little correlation between most of the demographic categories and whether or not they accepted the coupons. That said, there were several categories that stood out:

1. Younger people (age 26 and under) were the only age group to accept more coupons than not, and the group aged 50 had a significantly lower acceptance rate
2. Students and the unemployed were by far the most likely groups to accept the coupons
3. Gender, Education, Marital Status, and Having Children had very little effect on whether people would accept coupons or not

## Situational Data Breakdown

For the coffee coupons, there again was little correlation between most of the situational categories and whether or not they accepted the coupons. That said, there were several categories that stood out:

1. Winning the award for least surprising news, people were more likely to accept the coffee coupon in the morning (10am) and less likely to accept it in the evening (6pm)
2. Slightly more people accepted the coupon when it was warm out than medium or cold.
3. People are more likely to accept the coupon when they are traveling with a friend and less likely when driving alone
4. Also unsurprisingly, people with "No urgent place to go" were more likely to accept coupons than someone going somewhere

## Historical Data Breakdown

For the coffee coupons, there again was little correlation between most of the Historical categories and whether or not they accepted the coupons. That said, there were several categories that stood out:

1. People who get a lot of coffee were most likely to accept the coffee coupons
2. People who never get coffee were the least likely to accept the coupons

# Final Thoughts
From my analysis, it appears that acceptance rates for Coffee Coupons generally have little variation when we categorize them. We should certainly target poorer people who like coffee in the morning, but you don't need a data scientist to tell you that.
